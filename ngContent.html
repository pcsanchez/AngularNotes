<!-- Sometimes we have complex html content that we want to pass into the component from outside. -->
<!-- We can't add it between the closing and opening elements from our components-->
<!-- Everything placed in between the openeing and closing elemnts is lost by default -->
<!-- There is a special directive we can add into our component's template, this way we choose where the code inserted will go-->

<ng-content></ng-content>

<!-- This tells angular where to add the code -->
