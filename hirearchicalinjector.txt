Angulars dependency injector is a hirearchical injector
A component and its child componenets will recieve the same instance of a service.
Levles of Injection
1. App Module - Same instance of Service is available Application wide.
2. App Component - Same instance of service is available for all Components (but not for other services)
3. Any Other Component - Same instance of service is available for the components and all its child components
Specificity applies to services, services will overwrite according to this criteria
If you want the service to propagate down, you must not add the service in the providers array in the child components.
In order to inject a service into something, it has to have metadata. This is why adding services to services is different from everything else.
Add decorator @Injectable() to the receiving service in order for this to work.
